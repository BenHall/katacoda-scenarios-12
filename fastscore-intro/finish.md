We just scored a gradient boosting machine model written in python in batch mode and then quickly switched it to streaming.

We also went over all of the critical components needed to score a model in FastScore. The scoring happened in a FastScore engine customized for that model which can be saved as an image and referenced using any orchestration tool on any infrastructure that supports docker.

To set up FastScore on your own, please see our [Getting Started Guide](https://opendatagroup.github.io/Getting%20Started/Getting%20Started%20with%20FastScore/)!

To see a deeper explanation of the model set up for FastScore, please see our [GBM tutorial](https://opendatagroup.github.io/Knowledge%20Center/Tutorials/Gradient%20Boosting%20Regressor/)!
